## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Lists:**
    
    - `pendingList` stores incomplete tasks.
        
    - `completedList` stores finished tasks.
        
- **Menu Loop:** Runs until the user chooses to quit.
    
- **Mark Complete:** Moves an item from `pendingList` to `completedList`.

## ✨ Possible Improvements

- Save and load tasks from a file for persistence
    
- Add due dates and priorities
    
- Input validation for safer number parsing
    
- Support deleting tasks instead of just marking them complete
